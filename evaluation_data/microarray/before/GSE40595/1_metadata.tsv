GSM997591	Normal ovarian stroma - sample 5	GSM997591	Public on Sep 11 2014	Sep 04 2012	Sep 11 2014	RNA	1	Microdissected normal ovarian stroma	Homo sapiens	tissue: Microdissected normal ovarian stroma	total RNA	Cancer specimens were obtained from the primary tumors of previously untreated ovarian cancer patients at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Boston, MA). Normal human ovarian surface epithelium (HOSE) specimens were obtained from the normal ovaries of patients at the time of surgery for benign indications. All specimens were collected under protocols approved by the institutional review boards of the institution.	Frozen sections were affixed onto FRAME slides (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), fixed in 70% alcohol and stained by 1% methyl green. Air-dried tissue sections were then taken for microdissection using a MD LMD laser microdissecting microscope (Leica). Different types of tissues were dissected and harvested. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen).	Biotin	RNA samples were amplified and labeled using the two-cycle amplification protocol (Affymetrix).	9606	For each sample, 15 microgram of amplified biotinylated RNA was hybridized to a Human U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip array.	GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix) was used for array scanning and data collection.	Gene expression data from microdissected normal ovarian stroma	Microarray data analysis software, GeneSpring V.11.0.2 (Agilent Technologies Inc.) was used to perform the primary data analysis. RMA summerization algorithm was used and baseline transformation to median of all samples were performed.

All specimens were collected under protocols approved by the institutional review boards of the institution.	Frozen sections were affixed onto FRAME slides (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), fixed in 70% alcohol and stained by 1% methyl green. Air-dried tissue sections were then taken for microdissection using a MD LMD laser microdissecting microscope (Leica). Different types of tissues were dissected and harvested. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen).	Biotin	RNA samples were amplified and labeled using the two-cycle amplification protocol (Affymetrix).	9606	For each sample, 15 microgram of amplified biotinylated RNA was hybridized to a Human U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip array.	GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix) was used for array scanning and data collection.	Gene expression data from microdissected ovarian cancer stroma	Microarray data analysis software, GeneSpring V.11.0.2 (Agilent Technologies Inc.) was used to perform the primary data analysis. RMA summerization algorithm was used and baseline transformation to median of all samples were performed.

Normal human ovarian surface epithelium (HOSE) specimens were obtained from the normal ovaries of patients at the time of surgery for benign indications. All specimens were collected under protocols approved by the institutional review boards of the institution.	Frozen sections were affixed onto FRAME slides (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), fixed in 70% alcohol and stained by 1% methyl green. Air-dried tissue sections were then taken for microdissection using a MD LMD laser microdissecting microscope (Leica). Different types of tissues were dissected and harvested. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen).	Biotin	RNA samples were amplified and labeled using the two-cycle amplification protocol (Affymetrix).	9606	For each sample, 15 microgram of amplified biotinylated RNA was hybridized to a Human U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip array.	GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix) was used for array scanning and data collection.
