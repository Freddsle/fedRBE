  # The following options are for privacy, we recommend one of these tiers:
  # minimum privacy:
  #   smpc = False
  #   min_samples = 0
  # medium privacy, medium slowdown
  #   smpc = True
  #   min_samples = 0
  # maximum privacy, medium to high slowdown
  #   smpc = True

  # generally minimum or medium privacy is enough, only when covariates are
  # potentially known privacy might become an issue
  # With min samples > 0, the program might halt depending on the given data
